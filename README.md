Mackenzie Historical Building (Project)

This project was developed and used like a case study to a scientific initiation project in university.
It's a three-dimensional model of the historic building of the Mackenzie Presbyterian University that allows the interaction of the real time image with the user temporal representations of the model (augmented virtuality).
